# AutoScan
This is a basic mod that makes Deep Scans happen whenever your scanners would otherwise be idle (that is, whenever a scan finishes).
## Current features
- When a scan features, a new scan of the same kind is automatically scheduled, or a Deep Scan if it failed.
- When dropping out of hyperspace without an active scan, automatically start Deep Scanning the sector if possible.
